-- Question 1
-- Add the type signatures for the functions below and then remove the comments and try to compile.
-- (Use the types presented in the lecture.)
f1 :: Floating a => a -> a -> a -> a
f1 x y z = x ** (y/z)
f2 :: Floating a => a -> a -> a -> a
f2 x y z = sqrt (x/y - z)
f3 :: Show a => Char -> a -> [Char] -> [Char]
f3 x y z = x:(show y ++ z)
f4 :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool -> [Bool]
f4 x y z = (x > y) : [z]
f5 :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> [a] -> Bool
f5 x y z = x == (y ++ z)

-- f1 x y z = x ** (y/z)

-- f2 x y z = sqrt (x/y - z)

-- f3 x y = [x == True] ++ [y]

-- f4 x y z = x == (y ++ z)


-- Question 2
-- Are really all variables in Haskell immutable? Try googling for the answer.


-- Question 3
-- Why should we define type signatures of functions? How can they help you? How can they help others?


-- Question 4
-- Why should you define type signatures for variables? How can they help you?


-- Question 5
-- Are there any functions in Haskell that let you transform one type to the other? Try googling for the answer.


-- Question 6
-- Can you also define in Haskell list of lists? Did we showed any example of that? How would you access the inner
-- most elements?
